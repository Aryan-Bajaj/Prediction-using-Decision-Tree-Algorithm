# Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm (Level - Intermediate)

This project uses a decision tree algorithm to predict the species of an iris flower based on its features. The code is written in a Jupyter Notebook and uses libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn to perform data analysis and visualization.

## Getting Started

This project uses a Jupyter Notebook to perform prediction using a decision tree algorithm. The code imports necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. It reads data from a CSV file and performs exploratory data analysis and data visualization.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip by running the following command:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Installing

To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Run the code cells in the notebook to perform prediction using a decision tree algorithm.

## Running the tests

This project does not include any automated tests.

## Deployment
